## üß† About Me

I work at the intersection of machine learning, automation, and security engineering. My focus is applying generative AI to simplify threat modeling, reduce analyst fatigue, and make security workflows scalable and repeatable.

> _Security isn‚Äôt about more controls ‚Äî it‚Äôs about better ones. I write code, build tools, and publish research that helps teams get there._
